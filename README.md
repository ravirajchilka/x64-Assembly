# Why assembl language?
Assembly language is low level language comparing to C. Assembly languages vary based on the host system architecture. For Intel based 
Computers x86 assembly can be used depending upon 32 bit or 64 bit computers and there is different assembly language used for ARM based architecture. 
It is not necessary to learn assembly, however it helps to understand how computers work. Many programmers/developers working on 
higher programming languages do not know the basic working principles of computing systems. Learning assembly will make you stand out in the crowd of
highly competent developers/programmers.
