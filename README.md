# Why assembly language?
Assembly language is low level language comparing to C. Assembly languages vary based on the host system architecture. For Intel based 
Computers x86 assembly is used for 32 bit computers, and x64 for 64 bit machines and there is different assembly language used for ARM based architecture. 
It is not necessary to learn assembly, however it helps to understand how computers work. Many programmers/developers working on 
high level programming languages do not know the basic working principles of computing systems. Learning assembly will make you stand out in the crowd of
highly competent developers/programmers.
